## Testing

A thorough testing approach was carried out to ensure the new site's optimal operation and efficiency. The following efforts were taken to ensure the website's integrity and user experience:

1. **Cross-Browser Compatibility** The website underwent thorough manual testing across multiple web browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Brave Browser, and Microsoft Edge. This comprehensive evaluation process aimed to verify the site's performance and compatibility, ensuring consistent appearance and functionality across different platforms and browsers.

2. **Responsive Design Testing:**
The webpage was thoroughly tested using Google Chrome's 'Responsive-Viewer' application. This made it easy to determine how effectively the website worked on various devices, such as tablets, smartphones, laptops, and desktop PCs. These were used to carefully assess how responsive the website was. This rigorous testing technique proved the website's smooth performance across a variety of screen sizes and resolutions.

4. **Functionality Testing:** All interactive components, such as dropdown menus, sliders, and buttons, have been thoroughly tested to ensure flawless functioning and performance of their intended functions.

5. **Content Verification:** Every piece of text, image, and multimedia was reviewed to ensure that it was accurate, relevant, and properly formatted. To ensure that proper language and spelling were utilised across the website, the material was checked using Google Chrome's Grammarly feature.

6. **Accessibility Testing:** We used Google Chrome's 'Wave' function to determine whether the website met accessibility criteria. This programme evaluated the website's accessibility compliance to ensure that screen readers could use it and that alt text for photographs and other multimedia components was used correctly.

These rigorous testing techniques enabled the identification and correction of any issues or inconsistencies, resulting in a high-quality, operational website that was ready for launch.

### Future Testing

I hope to be able to add the following testing processes to my website when I can:

1. **Performance Testing:** Load times and general performance metrics will be measured using tools such as Google PageSpeed Insights and GTmetrix to identify and address any performance bottlenecks.

2. **Security Testing:** SSL certification, secure connections, and protection against typical vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting will all be verified.

### Validator Testing

I conducted extensive testing using a range of internet validators and tools to ensure the validity and adherence to web standards. The validation procedure is as follows:

1. HTML Validation: The HTML code was validated using the W3C Markup Validation Service, which looked for missing components, syntactical errors, and HTML standard conformance. Every page on the website was submitted to this (see index.html findings below).
- W3C HTML Test Results

2. CSS Validation: The CSS code was inspected using the W3C CSS Validation Service to identify any errors, warnings, or out-of-date syntax that could jeopardise stylistic and layout consistency.

3. JavaScript Validation: The JavaScript code for each page on the site was inspected using JSHint and Esprima respectively. I used any warnings or errors presented from these sites to be able to ensure the site was functioning as intended and all code-conventions were followed appropiately.

4. Performance Analysis: Performance data were analysed using tools such as Google PageSpeed Insights and Lighthouse to determine rendering speed, page load times, and overall performance improvement.

5. Mobile-Friendly Testing: The website's mobile friendliness was evaluated using Google Chrome's Developer Tools and Responsive Viewer, as well as testing across a range of screen sizes, device types, and orientations (including landscape and portrait). In this method, browser compatibility was also assessed. To ensure consistent rendering and functionality across several platforms, the website was tested on a wide range of browsers and browser versions (including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge).
