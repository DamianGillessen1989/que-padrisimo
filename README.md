## User Experience Design

In crafting this portfolio, I sought inspiration and guidance from key principles explained in "The Elements of User Experience" which was covered in the UX section of our course. My primary goal was to prioritize the needs and experiences of users, aiming to sculpt a journey that is both enriching and enjoyable for visitors.

## Project Planning Phases

I split the process of planning the project into five distinct phases:

- Strategy Plane
- Scope Plane
- Structure Plane
- Skeleton Plane
- Surface Plane

### Strategy Plane

My Objectives:

- I aimed to facilitate seamless navigation throughout the portfolio.
- I attempted to ensure textual clarity to prevent user confusion.
- I hoped to evoke positive emotional responses from users to foster engagement.
- I strived to maintain cohesion and relatability across all content elements.
- Lastly, I tried to organize content in a manner that avoids overwhelming users.

User Objectives:

My Objectives for First-time Visitors:

- To be able to swiftly grasp the purpose and extent of the portfolio.
- To be able to effortlessly navigate between sections and pages.
- To experience a sense of progression while exploring.
- I hoped to avoid visual fatigue induced by excessive content.
- Lastly, I hoped they would be able to resume browsing seamlessly after any interruptions.

Objectives for Returning Visitors:

- The user should easily locate contact details or social media links.
- They should be able to understand the information presented and engage easily in any relevant portfolio content.

### Scope Plane

To effectively manage the project's scope, I adopted a phased implementation approach:

Phase 1:

- Create a first draft of an Introduction/Home page offering a succinct overview.
- Create a first draft of an About Me page, which includes the details of my CV or resume, my work experience and education and the option to download a copy of my CV.
- Create a first draft of a Gallery of previous projects I've worked on for users to explore.
- Create a first draft of a user-friendly and interactive Contact page for users to get in touch should they wish.

Phase 2:

- Make a detailed expansion of individual project pages.
- Gather feedback from peers and test the functionality of the site.
- Solve any bugs or issues that should become apparent.

Phase 3:
- Final testing on sites like W3C.
- Project submission.

### Structure Plane

Given the nature of the portfolio and the lack of text-based content, considerable emphasis was placed on structuring the pages to sustain user attention and engagement:

Colour Palette:

- Light Grey
- Grey
- Navy Blue
- White

As an avid night-mode user, I wanted to design the page from scratch with night-mode in mind. A dark background was chosen to reduce visual strain and elevate the prominence of images and light text was chosen to accompany the theme. The colour scheme was meticulously crafted to deliver a visually pleasing and cohesive experience and images of a colourful and engaging nature were also included.

Typography:

- Raleway
- Open Sans

Consistent typography across all pages ensures readability and visual coherence - this is why I chose only two fonts to be used on-site. Diverse font weights and styles inject visual intrigue while preserving a professional aesthetic, so this was also kept in mind throughout the project.

### Skeleton Plane

Wireframes were meticulously crafted to visualize the project's layout and structure across diverse devices:

[Portfolio Wireframes](https://github.com/DamianGillessen1989/personal-portfolio-dg/blob/main/docs/dg-portfolio-wireframe.pdf)

These wireframes served as a first-draft blueprint for page layouts and responsiveness. Iterative adjustments were made during development to enhance user experience and resolve usability challenges.

## Resolved and Unsolved Bugs

### Resolved Bugs

During the development process of my personal resume website, several bugs were identified and resolved to ensure optimal performance and user experience:

- Initially, the main content section of the website was pushing the header and navbar upwards, causing them to become partially or entirely hidden from view. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the issue stemmed from the positioning properties applied to the header element. To fix this issue, I adjusted the positioning properties of the header element to ensure that it remains fixed at the top of the viewport while allowing the main content to scroll underneath it. [Header bug before-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/personal-portfolio-dg/main/docs/header-bug-before.webp) - [Header bug after-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/personal-portfolio-dg/main/docs/header-bug-after.webp)

- An issue arose in the skills section where the five skill boxes were only aligning vertically, disrupting the intended layout and presentation of the content. After a thorough investigation, it was determined that the problem stemmed from the box-sizing properties applied to the skill boxes. To resolve this issue, I modified the box-sizing properties to ensure that the skill boxes align horizontally, maintaining the desired layout and presentation. [Skill Box bug before-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/personal-portfolio-dg/main/docs/skill-box-before.webp) - [Skill Box bug after-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/personal-portfolio-dg/main/docs/skill-box-after.webp)

- Upon inspection of the header section, an issue was identified where the logo image was not displaying correctly. The logo image appeared to be cropped, with half of it extending beyond the right-hand side of the screen, disrupting the header's visual coherence and brand representation. After investigating the root cause of the problem, it was discovered that the issue stemmed from improper image sizing and alignment properties. To rectify this issue, I adjusted the dimensions and positioning of the logo image within the header section, ensuring that it displays correctly and aligns with the rest of the header content. [Header Logo bug before-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/personal-portfolio-dg/main/docs/header-logo-bug-before.webp) - [Header Logo bug after-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/personal-portfolio-dg/main/docs/header-logo-bug-after.webp)

- During the refinement of CSS styling for the website's layout, an unexpected issue emerged with the footer section. Following a modification in the CSS code to enhance styling elements, the footer mysteriously vanished from the screen altogether. Upon thorough investigation, it was revealed that the footer's sudden disappearance was caused by inadvertently setting its position to 'fixed'. To address this issue, I corrected the position property of the footer element, ensuring that it remains in its intended position at the bottom of the page. [Footer bug before-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/personal-portfolio-dg/main/docs/footer-bug-before.webp) - [Footer bug after-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/personal-portfolio-dg/main/docs/footer-bug-after.webp)

- Upon inspecting the contact section of the website, a perplexing issue surfaced where the form elements were disorganized and scattered across the page, rendering the form non-functional. Despite thorough scrutiny, the root cause of this erratic behaviour remained elusive. However, a breakthrough occurred when I realized that restructuring the layout using a flexbox approach could potentially resolve the issue. Implementing this strategy, I transformed the contact section into a flex container and made adjustments to the flex-direction property. [Contact Form bug before-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/personal-portfolio-dg/main/docs/contact-form-bug-before.webp) - [Contact Form bug after-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/personal-portfolio-dg/main/docs/contact-form-bug-after.webp)

### Unresolved Bugs

- An anomaly surfaced during testing when the gallery exhibited usability issues specifically in landscape mode mobile or small-screen devices. In this configuration, the gallery modal elements appeared off-screen and rendered unusable, presenting a significant impediment to user interaction.
